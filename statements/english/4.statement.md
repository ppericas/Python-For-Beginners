Create a base class called Vehicle with a method start. Then, create two derived classes Car and Motorcycle that inherit from Vehicle and override the start method to print a specific message.
Put a print for each method to check that they execute correctly.
Example of execution and output.
car = Car()
motorcycle = Motorcycle()
car.start()  # Output: Car started
motorcycle.start()   # Output: Motorcycle started

# Activity 12. Multiple inheritance
Create a class Person with attributes like name and age. Then, create an Employee class that inherits from Person and has an additional attribute for the salary.
Check its operation by printing the attributes of an employee.

Example of execution and output.
employee1 = Employee("John", 30, 50000)
print(employee1.name, employee1.age, employee1.salary)

# Activity 13. Inheritance and specific methods
Create a base class Animal with a move method. Then, create two derived classes Bird and Fish that inherit from Animal and have additional methods like fly and swim respectively. Also, for Fish, you should create its own move method to override the general one.
Add a print to each method so that its execution can be observed.

Example of execution and output.
bird = Bird()
fish = Fish()
bird.move()  # Output: The animal moves somehow
bird.fly()  # Output: The bird flies through the sky
fish.move()     # Output: The animal moves somehow
fish.swim()     # Output: The fish swims in the water

# Activity 14: Vehicles
Create a base class called Vehicle that has the common attributes to all vehicles, such as the number of wheels and the current speed. Include a method to accelerate.
Then create a derived class called Car that inherits from Vehicle. Add an additional attribute for the number of doors. Override the accelerate method to print a specific message for a car.
Finally, create a derived class called Bicycle that inherits from Vehicle. Add an additional attribute for the type of bicycle (mountain, road, etc.). Override the accelerate method to print a specific message for a bicycle.

Example of execution and output.
car = Car(wheels=4, doors=4)
bicycle = Bicycle(wheels=2, type="Mountain")
car.accelerate(30)
bicycle.accelerate(15)

# Activity 15: Recursion
Create a class called RecursiveCalculator that has a recursive method called calculate_factorial. The method should calculate the factorial of a given number and update an attribute called result in each recursive call.
You can also make the recursive method to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.

Example of execution and output.
calculator = RecursiveCalculator()
number = 5
factorial_result = calculator.calculate_factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is: {factorial_result}")

# Activity 16
In case your previous exercise does not allow calculating different factorials with the same object, modify the class to do so.

Example of execution and output.
calculator = RecursiveCalculator()
number = 5
factorial_result = calculator.calculate_factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is: {factorial_result}")
Reset the result
calculator.reset_result()
Calculate another factorial
another_number = 3
another_result = calculator.calculate_factorial(another_number)
print(f"The factorial of {another_number} is: {another_result}")

# Activity 17
Create a base class called Character with attributes of a position on the map X, Y.
They will also have the methods
* moveRight(): add one position to X
* moveLeft(): subtract one position from X
* moveUp(): add one position to Y
* moveDown(): subtract one position from Y

Create two derived classes called Player and Enemy that descend from Character and define some interesting attribute such as their name for example.
Create two objects, one for Player and one for Enemy.
Place the enemy object at a position on the map (define x and y)
Create a loop to move the player until it encounters the enemy.
Each step the player takes should appear on the screen
If the enemy collides with the player, the player will lose the game.

# Activity 18. Static elements
Build a class called Store in Python that maintains a global inventory of products. Each time a new product is added to the inventory, the total product counter in the store must be incremented. Use static methods and attributes to implement this functionality.
The class should have the following elements:
1. A static attribute called total_products representing the global product counter in the store.
2. A static method called add_product() that increments the product counter each time it is called and displays a message indicating that a product has been added to the inventory.
3. A static method called get_total_products() that returns the total number of products in the store.

Create instances of the class and use the static methods to add products to the inventory and get the total number of products in the store.

Example of execution and output.
Adding products to the inventory by calling the static method
Store.add_product()
Store.add_product()
Get the total number of products
total = Store.get_total_products()
print(f"Total products in the store: {total}")
Output: Total products in the store: 2

# Activity 19
Build a class called Product in Python that represents a product in a store. Each time an instance of Product is created, a static counter that keeps track of the total number of products in the store must be incremented. In addition, each product must have a name and a price.
The Product class should have the following elements:
1. A static attribute called total_products representing the global product counter in the store.
2. A static method called get_total_products() that returns the total number of products in the store.
3. A constructor that takes the name and price of the product as parameters and assigns these values to the instance attributes.
4. An instance method show_info() that prints the name and price of the product.

Create instances of the Product class and use both static methods and instance methods to manage product information and get the total number of products in the store.

Example of execution and output.
Create some products
product1 = Product("Shirt", 20.99)
product2 = Product("Shoes", 49.99)
Display product information
product1.show_info()
Output: Product: Shirt, Price: $20.99
product2.show_info()
Output: Product: Shoes, Price: $49.99
Get the total number of products by calling the static method
total = Product.get_total_products()
print(f"Total products in the store: {total}")
Output: Total products in the store: 2

# Activity 20
Create a system of classes related to vehicles. Define a base class called Vehicle with the following characteristics:
1. Attributes: brand and model.
2. Methods:
   1. A constructor to initialize the attributes.
   2. A method called information that prints the basic information of the vehicle (brand and model).
Then, create two derived classes from Vehicle called Car and Motorcycle. Both classes should inherit from Vehicle and include specific characteristics for each type of vehicle. For example:
* Car can have additional attributes such as num_doors and body_type.
* Motorcycle can have additional attributes such as displacement and bike_type.
Implement an information method in each derived class that calls the information method of the base class and then prints the specific information of the vehicle type.
Finally, create instances of the Car and Motorcycle classes, and use polymorphism to call their information methods from a list of objects of type Vehicle.

Execution example and output using a common function.
Create instances of the classes
car = Car("Toyota", "Land Cruiser", 4, "Off-road")
motorcycle = Motorcycle("Honda", "VT Shadow", "750cc", "Cruiser")
Using polymorphism by calling a common function
vehicles = [car, motorcycle]
for vehicle in vehicles:
   show_vehicle_information(vehicle)
Output:
Vehicle: Toyota Land Cruiser
Type: Car, Doors: 4, Body Type: Off-road
Vehicle: Honda VT Shadow
Type: Motorcycle, Displacement: 750cc, Type: Cruiser

Execution example and output using the information methods.
Create instances of the classes
car = Car("Toyota", "Land Cruiser", 4, "Off-road")
motorcycle = Motorcycle("Honda", "VT Shadow", "750cc", "Cruiser")
Use polymorphism to call the information methods
vehicles = [car, motorcycle]
for vehicle in vehicles:
   vehicle.information()
Output:
Vehicle: Toyota Land Cruiser
Type: Car, Doors: 4, Body Type: Off-road
Vehicle: Honda VT Shadow
Type: Motorcycle, Displacement: 750cc, Type: Cruiser

# Activity 21
Create a system of classes related to geometric figures. Define a base class called Figure with a method called area that returns the area of the figure. Then, create two derived classes called Rectangle and Circle. Both classes should inherit from Figure and implement their own area method.
Add a method called information in each derived class that prints information about the figure, including its type and area.
Create instances of the Rectangle and Circle classes, and use polymorphism to call their information and area methods from a list of objects of type Figure.

Execution example and output.
Create instances of the classes
rectangle = Rectangle(5, 8)
circle = Circle(3)
Call the information and area methods with polymorphism
figures = [rectangle, circle]
for figure in figures:
   figure.information()
   print(f"Area: {figure.area()}\n")
Output:
Figure Type: Rectangle, Area: 40
Area: 40
Figure Type: Circle, Area: 28.274333882308138
Area: 28.274333882308138
