# UD3: Exception Handling

## List Comprehension (Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries)

### Activity 1:
Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

### Activity 2:
Create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10. Create a list of cubes of numbers from 1 to 10.

### Activity 3:
Create a list of the first 10 even numbers. Create a list of even numbers between 0 and 10.

### Activity 4:
Create a list of alphabet letters. Use the `string` module.

### Activity 5:
Create a list of vowels in the alphabet using a loop that iterates over a string with all the alphabet letters. Create the same version of the program using ASCII character codes → Activity 4.

### Activity 6:
Create a list of words from a sentence.

### Activity 7:
Create a list of words that start with the letter "a" from a sentence.

### Activity 8:
Create a list of prime numbers from 1 to 100. [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97] Create a list with the first 100 prime numbers.

### Activity 9:
Create a list of permutations of a list of numbers (using `itertools.permutations()`). For example, if we input the list (1,2,3), we should get a result similar to `[(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)]`. Also, create a list of permutations of a word.

### Activity 10:
Create a list of combinations of 2 numbers from 1 to 10 (using itertools and combinations). Create a list of combinations of 3 numbers from 1 to 10 (using itertools and combinations).

### Activity 11:
Create a list of sums of numbers from 1 to 10. Create a list of subtractions of numbers from 10 to 1. Create a list of products of numbers from 1 to 10. Create a list of divisions of numbers from 10 to 1.

### Activity 12:
Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 5.

### Activity 13:
Create a list that iterates over numbers from 1 to 10 and if the value is even, display that value, but if it's odd, display the boolean `False`.

### Activity 14:
Create a dictionary containing the squares of the first 5 integers (starting from 1) using dictionary comprehension. {1:1, 2:4, 3:9, …}.

### Activity 15:
Define a starting value and calculate the square of the next "n" values. The user should input these two parameters via the console. Do this using compressed dictionaries. For example, if start=5 and n=3, it should display {6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}.

### Activity 16:
Given a list of words, create a dictionary that maps each word to its length using dictionary comprehension. An example list could be: `words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]`, and in this case, the output would be, `{'apple': 5, 'banana': 6, 'cherry': 6, 'date': 4, 'elderberry': 10}`.

### Activity 17:
In this case, iterate over the first 5 integers and only keep those whose square is even.

### Activity 18:
Given a text string, create a dictionary that counts the number of times each vowel appears in the string using dictionary comprehension. For example, if the text string is "hello world", the result would be `{'a': 0, 'e': 1, 'i': 0, 'o': 2, 'u': 0}`.

### Activity 19:
Create a dictionary that iterates over the first 10 natural numbers and if they are prime, their value should be True, otherwise, False.

### Activity 20:
Given a list of words, create a dictionary that groups the words by their first letter using dictionary comprehension. For example, if we input the list `words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "cucumber", "elderberry", "apricot", "avocado"]`, it should output `{'b': ['banana'], '

a': ['apple', 'apricot', 'avocado'], 'c': ['cherry', 'cucumber'], 'e': ['elderberry']}`.

### Activity 21:
Create a nested dictionary representing the multiplication tables from 1 to 5 with multiplications from 0 to 10 included.

### Activity 22:
Create a dictionary containing the squares of the first 10 integers, but using a custom function to calculate the squares.

### Activity 23:
Create a dictionary containing the squares of even numbers and the cubes of odd numbers, for the first 10 integers.

### Activity 24:
Write a Python program that generates a compressed dictionary for the current month. Each key of the dictionary should represent a day of the month, from 1 to the last day of the month, and the value associated with each day should be True if the sum of the digits of that day is a prime number, and False otherwise. To accomplish this task, you need to implement the following functions:
* days_in_month(month): A function that takes the month and returns the number of days in that month. Assume February as a non-leap year, i.e., 28 days.
* sum_of_digits(n): A function that takes an integer and calculates the sum of its digits.
* is_prime(num): A function that determines if a number is prime.
Use these functions in conjunction with dictionary comprehension to generate the desired dictionary for the current month. Make sure to provide the expected output of the program.

### Activity 25:
We have the following lists:
months = ["ENERO","FEBRERO","MARZO","ABRIL","MAYO","JUNIO","JULIO","AGOSTO","SEPTIEMBRE","OCTUBRE","NOVIEMBRE","DICIEMBRE"]
days_in_month = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
Create a compressed dictionary to place in each position the name of the month and in the value how many days it has.

### Activity 26:
Create a compressed list called `usuarios` of user lists. The `separar(x)` function receives the name and surname of a person as a parameter and returns a list with the separated values. 
For example, "PEDRO SANZ MAIMON" → ["PEDRO", "SANZ", "MAIMON"].
Define a list of full names of different people to develop this activity.
nombres=["PEDRO SANZ MAIMON", "ANA MENA GARCIA", …]

# Exception Handling

## Activity 1:
Write a program that reads an integer from the user and then prints a message indicating whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. If the user enters an incorrect value (e.g., a word), give an error message.

## Activity 2:
Write a program that reads an integer from the user and then attempts to divide it by another integer. If the second number is zero, print an error message.

## Activity 3:
Write a program that reads a string from the user and then attempts to convert it to an integer. If the string cannot be converted to an integer, print an error message.

## Activity 4:
Write a program that reads a list of integers from the user and then attempts to calculate the sum of the numbers. If the list is empty, print an error message.

## Activity 5:
Write a program that attempts to open a file. If the file does not exist, print an error message.

## Activity 6:
Write a program that attempts to call a function that does not exist. If the function does not exist, catch the exception and display an error message.

## Activity 7:
Write a program that attempts to access an element of a list that does not exist. If the element does not exist, catch the exception and display an error message.

## Activity 8:
Write a program that attempts to convert a string to a number. If the string cannot be converted to a number, catch the exception and display an error message.

## Activity 9:
Write a program that attempts to open a file in write mode, but the file is already open in read mode. If the file is already open, catch the exception and display an error message.
